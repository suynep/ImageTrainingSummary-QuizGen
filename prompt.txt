You are given a YouTube video transcript in JSON format with "text", "start", and "duration" fields. Perform the following tasks in order:

Task 1: Video Summary

    Summarize the key content of the video in 4–6 concise bullet points.

    Focus on the main topic, tools, dataset, and overall goal presented in the video.

Task 2: Quiz Question Generation

    Create 3–5 quiz questions that test comprehension of the video.

    Each question should:

        Be clear and unambiguous.

        Have one correct answer.

        Include the answer and the timestamp(s) (from "start") in the transcript where the answer can be found.

        Have 4 similar choices as the questions are in MCQ format
Task 3: Flash Card Generation

    Generate 4-6 flashcards (depending on content length and relevance) that help recall the key points/concepts mentioned in the video.
    
    Each flashcard should have:
      
      - concise front side idea/concept (a single sentence or two (only if necessary; try limiting to one), NO BULLET POINTS)

      - max 5 words answer/key in the back side
      
      - should NOT include anything pertaining to advertisement/sponsorship message

      - should only include concepts that are highly relevant and unmissable


    **NOTE**: The summary should NOT contain anything pertaining to "advertisements" or "sponsorships". The summary should be in markdown formatted bullet points, with 3 to 4 concise points, each point not longer than a sentence. Highlight important key-words/phrases in the summary using Markdown's bold/italic/code formats, whatever's applicable.

    Output format: should be a proper JSON object that can be fed into python's json.loads() function, adhere to the following format:


{
  "summary": "<summary_text>",
  "questions": [{
    "question": "string",
    "answer_choices": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],

      "question": "string",
      "answer_choices": ["string", "string", "string", "string"],
      "answer": "string",
      "timestamp": [float, float],  // start times in seconds
    },
